# Welcome to WXT!

WXT is a modern, open-source framework for building web extensions. Inspired by Nuxt, its goals are to:

- Provide an awesome [DX](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/what-is-developer-experience/)
- Provide first-class support for all major browsers

Check out the [comparison](/guide/resources/compare) to see how WXT compares to other tools for building web extensions.

## Prerequisites

These docs assume you have a basic knowledge of how browser extensions are structured and how you access the extension APIs.

:::warning New to extension development?
If you have never written an extension before, follow Chrome's [Hello World tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world) to first **_create an extension without WXT_**, then come back here.
:::

You should also be aware of [Chrome's extension docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions) and [Mozilla's extension docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions). WXT does not change how you use the extension APIs, and you'll need to refer to these docs often when using specific APIs.

Alright, got a basic understanding of how web extensions are structured? Do you know how to access the extension APIs? Then continue to the [Installation page](/guide/installation) to create your first WXT extension.
