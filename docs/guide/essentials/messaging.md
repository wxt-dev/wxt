# Messaging

[Chrome Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/messaging) â€¢ [Firefox Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts#communicating_with_background_scripts)

Read the docs linked above to learn more about using the vanilla messaging APIs.

## Alternatives

The vanilla APIs are difficult to use and are a pain point to many new extension developers. For this reason, WXT recommends installing an NPM package that wraps around the vanilla APIs.

Here are some popular messaging libraries that support all browsers and work with WXT:

- [`trpc-chrome`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trpc-chrome) - [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) adapter for Web Extensions.
- [`webext-bridge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webext-bridge) - Messaging in WebExtensions made super easy. Out of the box.
- [`@webext-core/messaging`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webext-core/messaging) - Light weight, type-safe wrapper around the web extension messaging APIs
- [`@webext-core/proxy-service`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webext-core/proxy-service) - A type-safe wrapper around the web extension messaging APIs that lets you call a function from anywhere, but execute it in the background.
- [`Comctx`](https://github.com/molvqingtai/comctx) - Cross-context RPC solution with type safety and flexible adapters.
