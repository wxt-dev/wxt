            If a package needs released, please [run the workflow](https://github.com/wxt-dev/wxt/actions/workflows/release.yml).

            Before running, consider:
            - Are there any breaking changes? If so, prepare a list of breaking changes and update the changelog and release notes after the release.
            - Are there any PRs open that we wait to release after they're merged?
